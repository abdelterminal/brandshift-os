# Decisions

Locked choices and why. Revisit deliberately, not by accident.

Date established: 2 September 2026.

## Product

**BrandShift OS is a multi-tenant SaaS with an ERP side and a CRM side.**
Inspiration: Slack's speed, shell and sense of place; Odoo's module breadth.
The success criterion is not feature count -- it is that no user is ever confused about where
they are or what to do next.

## Locked

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Stack | Next.js 16 + PostgreSQL 17 | The previous Angular + Django + MongoEngine stack could not reach the target UX without a rewrite of tenancy, permissions, and the embedded-task schema anyway. Postgres suits relational ERP/CRM data; MongoDB did not. |
| Database & auth | Self-hosted Postgres in Docker, custom JWT | Everything stays on the local network. No cloud dependency, no monthly cost, no vendor auth lock-in. |
| Deployment | Docker Compose on the LAN only | Same operating model as the previous app. Not Vercel. |
| Data | Fresh start with realistic seed data | Lets the schema be designed correctly for ERP/CRM instead of inheriting Mongo document shapes. The old app keeps its data and stays the system of record until Phase 2 parity. |
| Tenancy | Multi-tenant from day one | Every tenant-owned table carries `organization_id`. Costs ~10% more effort now and zero later; retrofitting tenancy means touching every table, query and screen. |
| Roles | Named roles + per-module permissions | `owner \| admin \| manager \| member` plus module flags (`finance`, `people`, `crm`, `insights`). The old app's binary ADMIN/EMPLOYEE cannot express "can see salaries" or "can issue invoices". Odoo's model, minus the complexity of a full custom role builder. |
| Language | English + French, both complete | Actual users work in French. Both locales ship together per screen; no half-translated states. |
| Slack DNA | Shell + command palette now, channels later | The left rail, instant switching and Cmd+K deliver most of the "feels like Slack" sensation at low risk. The channel/thread model is a real-time platform build and waits for Phase 2 -- but `activity_events` is designed now as the feed spine it will attach to. |
| Theme | Light and dark equal, one token set | Dense ERP/CRM tables need light; the brand's character wants dark. One token set means neither is a retrofit. |
| Phase 1 | Foundation + one vertical slice | Foundation, shell, auth, then People and Work fully built. Attendance, Meetings, Inbox, Insights, CRM and ERP follow against a proven base rather than being designed blind. |
| Repo | `abdelterminal/brandshift-os`, private, new app only | Clean history. The old repo `abdelterminal/brandshiftsaas` stays where it is, untouched and still running. |

## Carried forward from the old project

Design direction, brand rules and information architecture come from the audit recorded in
`BRANDSHIFT_UX_REDESIGN_HANDOFF.md` in the previous repo. The substance is distilled into
`CLAUDE.md`; that file is now the source of truth and the old document is history.

Two findings from the old `ARCHITECTURE.md` are fixed by construction here rather than deferred:

1. **JWT in `localStorage`** was listed as architectural priority #2. Now an HttpOnly cookie plus
   a server-side session digest, from the first commit.
2. **Tasks embedded in the project document** was flagged as a document-growth and write-contention
   risk. `tasks` is a first-class table here.

## Added during M4 (authentication)

**The `sessions` digest check runs in the page, not the middleware.**
The roadmap said "digest check in middleware". Doing that literally means a database round trip
-- and a second connection pool -- in front of every request, including static assets, which is a
bad trade for a self-hosted app. Instead the middleware verifies the JWT's signature and expiry
(no database, no Node-only crypto) and uses that to route; `requireUser()` does the full check --
digest, revocation, expiry, password-change invalidation -- and the `(app)` layout calls it on
every render. A revoked session therefore still cannot see a single page. The middleware is a
routing decision; the page is the security boundary. The only practical difference is one wasted
redirect for a cookie that is signed but no longer live.

**Only a digest of the token's `jti` is stored.** The cookie holds an HS256 JWT carrying a random
32-byte `jti`; `sessions.token_digest` holds SHA-256 of it. A leaked database yields nothing
replayable as a cookie. The signature proves we issued the token; the digest lookup proves the
session is still live. Both are required, which is the whole reason the table exists rather than
trusting the JWT alone.

**Changing a password invalidates every other session without a sweep.** `getCurrentUser()`
refuses any session row created before `users.password_changed_at`, so one column does the work of
a bulk update. The device doing the change is re-issued, so nobody signs themselves out of the
browser they are sitting in front of.

**403 never costs you your session.** `unauthorized()` clears the cookie; `forbidden()` touches
nothing. The old app signed people out on a permission error, which lost whatever they were in the
middle of and taught them that clicking the wrong link is expensive.

## Deliberately not chosen

- **Supabase / managed Postgres** -- would have given Realtime and RLS for free, but the
  requirement is that everything runs on the local network.
- **Restyling the existing Angular app** -- cheaper, but tenancy, permissions and the task schema
  all block the target UX.
- **A full custom role builder** -- a whole feature area and easy to make confusing. Named roles
  plus module flags cover the real cases. Revisit if a customer actually asks.
- **Postgres row-level security** -- auth is custom, so tenancy is enforced in app code via
  `withOrg()`. Accepted risk; the guardrail is that no raw query on a tenant table is permitted.
